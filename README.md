# Project Lazy

This is a web application that creates a network of data for better lookup and to ultimately create the "button" that does all the things.

## Built With

  - The server mux employs the [julienschmidt/httprouter](https://godoc.org/github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)
- SPA front end uses Angular

## To-Do
- [ ] Build REST-ful API in Go with help from [Todd McLeod's Golang Web Development Course](https://github.com/GoesToEleven/golang-web-dev)

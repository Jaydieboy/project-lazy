# Project Lazy

This is a web application that creates a network of data for better lookup and to ultimately create the "button" that does all the things.

## Built With

- The backend uses the Go programming language
  - The server mux employs the [julienschmidt/httprouter](https://godoc.org/github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)
- SPA front end uses Angular

## To-Do
- [ ] Create an Ubuntu docker container to set up the Neo4j Go Driver
- [ ] Build REST-ful API in Go with help from [Todd McLeod's Golang Web Development Course](https://github.com/GoesToEleven/golang-web-dev)
- [ ] Connect backend to a Neo4j server using the [Official Neo4j Go Driver](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver)

## Just Notes

Cite code snippets as follows:
```
/***************************************************************************************
*    Title: <title of program/source code>
*    Author: <author(s) names>
*    Date: <date>
*    Code version: <code version>
*    Availability: <where it's located>
*
***************************************************************************************/
```

Does this need to happen of I have adapted a concept for my code from someone else?
